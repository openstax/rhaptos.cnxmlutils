    >Introduction</h3>
    <p
      id='id62175'
    >All the objects that we see in the world around us, are made of
      <strong>matter</strong>. Matter makes up the air we breathe, the ground we walk on, the food we eat and the animals and plants that live around us. Even our own human bodies are made of matter!
    </p>
    <p
      id='id62185'
    >Different objects can be made of different types of matter, or
      <strong>materials</strong>. For example, a cupboard (an
      <em
        data-effect='italics'
      >object</em>) is made of wood, nails and hinges (the
      <em
        data-effect='italics'
      >materials</em>). The
      <strong>properties</strong>of the materials will affect the properties of the object. In the example of the cupboard, the strength of the wood and metals make the cupboard strong and durable. In the same way, the raincoats that you wear during bad weather, are made of a material that is waterproof. The electrical wires in your home are made of metal because metals are a type of material that is able to conduct electricity. It is very important to understand the properties of materials, so that we can use them in our homes, in industry and in other applications. In this chapter, we will be looking at different types of materials and their properties.

      >Brittle materials break easily. Materials that are malleable can be easily formed into different shapes. Ductile materials are able to be formed into long wires.</li>

    >Discussion: Everyday materials</span>In groups of 3 or 4 look at the labels of medicines, food items, and any other items that you use often. What can you tell about the material inside the container from the list of ingredients? Why is it important to have a list of ingredients on the materials that we use? Do some research on the safety data of the various compounds in the items that you looked at. Are the compounds in the items safe to use? In the food items, what preservatives and additives are there? Are these preservatives and additives good for you? Are there natural alternatives (natural alternatives are usually used by indigenous people groups)?

      id='id62584'
    >We see mixtures all the time in our everyday lives. A stew, for example, is a mixture of different foods such as meat and vegetables; sea water is a mixture of water, salt and other substances, and air is a mixture of gases such as carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen.</p>

      A
        <strong>mixture</strong>is a combination of two or more substances, where these substances are not bonded (or joined) to each other.

        <em
          data-effect='italics'
        >are not in a fixed ratio</em>Imagine, for example, that you have a 250 ml beaker of water. It doesn't matter whether you add 20 g, 40 g, 100 g or any other mass of sand to the water; it will still be called a mixture of sand and water.

To separate something by 'mechanical means', means that there is no chemical process involved. In our sand and water example, it is possible to separate the mixture by simply pouring the water through a filter. Something
        <em
          data-effect='italics'
        >physical</em> is done to the mixture, rather than something

      <p
        id='id62715'
      >A
        <strong>heterogeneous</strong> mixture does not have a definite composition. Think of a pizza, that has a topping of cheese, tomato, mushrooms and peppers (the topping is a mixture). Each slice will probably be slightly different from the next because the toppings (the tomato, cheese, mushrooms and peppers) are not evenly distributed. Another example would be granite, a type of rock. Granite is made up of lots of different mineral substances including quartz and feldspar. But these minerals are not spread evenly through the rock and so some parts of the rock may have more quartz than others. Another example is a mixture of oil and water. Although you may add one substance to the other, they will stay separate in the mixture. We say that these heterogeneous mixtures are
        <em
          data-effect='italics'
        >non-uniform</em>, in other words they are not exactly the same throughout.

      >Homogeneous mixtures</h4>
      <p
        id='id62762'
      >A
        <strong>homogeneous</strong>mixture has a definite composition, and specific properties. In a homogeneous mixture, the different parts cannot be seen. A solution of salt dissolved in water is an example of a homogeneous mixture. When the salt dissolves, it will spread evenly through the water so that all parts of the solution are the same, and you can no longer see the salt as being separate from the water. Think also of a powdered drink that you mix with water. Provided you give the container a good shake after you have added the powder to the water, the drink will have the same sweet taste for anyone who drinks it, it won't matter whether they take a sip from the top or from the bottom. The air we breathe is another example of a homogeneous mixture since it is made up of different gases which are in a constant ratio, and which can't be visually distinguished from each other (i.e. you can't see the different components).

      >An
        <strong>alloy</strong>is a homogeneous mixture of two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal, where the resulting material has metallic properties. Alloys are usually made to improve the properties of the elements that make them up. For example steel is much stronger than iron (which is the main component of steel).

    >Pure Substances: Elements and Compounds</h3>
    <p
      id='id63273'
    >Any material that is not a mixture, is called a
      <strong>pure substance</strong>. Pure substances include
      <strong>elements</strong> and
      <strong>compounds</strong>. It is much more difficult to break down pure substances into their parts, and complex chemical methods are needed to do this.
    </p>
    <p
      id='eip-862'
    >One way to determine if a substance is pure is to look at its melting or boiling point. Pure substances will have a sharply defined melting or boiling point (i.e. the melting or boiling point will be a single temperature rather than a range of temperatures.) Impure substances have a temperature range over which they melt or boil. We can also use chromatography to determine if a substance is pure or not. Chromatography is the process of separating substances into their individual components. If a substance is pure then chromatography will only produce one substance at the end of the process. If a substance is impure then several substances will be seen at the end of the process.</p>

        >Interesting fact</div>Recently it was agreed that two more elements would be added to the list of officially named elements. These are elements number 114 and 116. The proposed name for element 114 is flerovium and for element 116 it is moscovium. This brings the total number of officially named elements to 114.

    >Giving names and formulae to substances</h3>

    >Think about what you call your friends. Their full name is like the substances name and their nickname is like the substances formulae. Without these names your friends would have no idea which of them you are referring to. In the same way scientists like to have a consistent way of naming things and a short way of describing the thing being named. This helps scientists to communicate efficiently.</p>

    >It is easy to describe elements and mixtures. We simply use the names that we find on the periodic table for elements and we use words to describe mixtures. But how are compounds named? In the example of iron sulphide that was used earlier, which element is named first, and which 'ending' is given to the compound name (in this case, the ending is -ide)?</p>

        <strong>suffix</strong> (ending) of -ide. You would have seen this in some of the examples we have used so far.

      >Metalloids or semi-metals have mostly non-metallic properties. One of their distinguishing characteristics is that their conductivity increases as their temperature increases. This is the opposite of what happens in metals. This property is known as semi-conductance and the materials are called semi-conductors. Semi-conductors are important in digital electronics, such as computers. The metalloids include elements such as silicon (
